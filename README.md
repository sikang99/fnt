Fast Numeric Transforms for Go. Currently only provides 1-dimensional discrete Hartley transform. Discrete Fourier transform to come soon.

## To Do
 * Minor fixes to Fourier transform to make ready for commit.
 * Remove redundant factor computation due to symmetries.
 * Explore more localized algorithm for Hartley transform.
