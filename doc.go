// Fast Numeric Transforms for Go. Provides 1-dimensional discrete Hartley and
// Fourier transforms. Both transforms are implemented as iterative radix-2
// Cooley-Tukey algorithms. Work is based loosely on implementations given by
// JÃ¶rg Arndt in [Matters Computational](http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook).
